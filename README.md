# LyPlayer
Lightweight Python all-in-one media player based off libvlc.

# Notes
This build is here for backup purposes. 
It requires a Youtube data API dev key, and there is no setup file.
Use at your own risk.

This program was inherrently flawed but it was a better option than anything else I could actually run. It was also a good first learning experience. That being said, it is entirely deprecated and while for all I know it still works I wouldn't advise using it anyways.
